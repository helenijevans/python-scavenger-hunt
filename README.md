# Python Scavenger Hunt 🕵️‍♀️

Welcome to the Python Scavenger Hunt!  
Your goal is to solve three small coding challenges, debug or implement the given files, and then combine the results to decode a hidden message.

---

## Challenge Overview

### **Challenge 1 – `file1.py`**
- **Type:** Debugging  
- **Task:** The file contains a function `total_odds(nums)` that calculates the sum of odd numbers.  
- **Goal:** Fix any bugs, run the file, and get the correct output. This is your first clue.

---

### **Challenge 2 – `file2.py`**
- **Type:** Debugging  
- **Task:** The file contains a function that calculates a sum based on ASCII values of certain characters in a string.  
- **Goal:** Fix any bugs, run the file, and get the correct output. This is your second clue.
---

### **Challenge 3 – `file3.py`**
- **Type:** Implementation  
- **Task:** Implement the function `line_with_longest_word(file_path)` to find the line number containing the longest word in `file3.txt`.  
- **Goal:** Your function should return an **integer** (the line number) as the third clue.

## **Final Step – `solve.py`**
Once you have the results from all three files:

1. Run `solve.py`  
2. When prompted, **enter the results** from each file in order:  
   - Clue 1 → output from `file1.py`   
   - Clue 2 → output from `file2.py` 
   - Clue 3 → output from `file3.py` 
3. The script will then process the clues and display the **decoded message**!
